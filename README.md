PSP Classics

A resource dedicated to PSP Classics on PS3 information.

Goals:
- Display compatibility information in a user-friendly way, sourced from the PS Dev Wiki.
- Catalog games that are currently missing data.
- Facilitate testing, issue tracking and the creation of config files via GitHub Issues.

The ultimate end goal of this project is to create a community-driven movement to complete PSP compatibility on PS3 and improve it to the best experience possible.
